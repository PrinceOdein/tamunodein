## Overview

StarSlayers (SLAY) is a Solidity-based token smart contract deployed on
the Sepolia testnet.

## Problem

Many token projects stop at compilation without real deployment or
testing.

## Solution

The contract was written, tested, and deployed using Hardhat to a public
testnet.

## What I Learned

- Solidity best practices
- Hardhat workflows
- Testnet deployment
