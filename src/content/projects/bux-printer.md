## Overview

BuX Printer is an online marketplace designed to connect customers with
printing vendors and logistics providers, similar in concept to Jiji,
but focused specifically on printing services.

## Problem

Clients often struggle to find reliable printing vendors and logistics
support in one place.

## Solution

The platform centralizes vendors, orders, and delivery coordination
into a single system.
